    description: `This project was the result of my master thesis. I proposed a novel architecture based on the Transformer architecture.
    This model is capable of fusing information from multiple modalities, including: text, images, video, audio and tabular data. With this model
    I achieved state of the art results in the task of multimodal movie genre classification. This project was accepted as a research paper at the
    NAACL conference of 2021 in the MAI (Multimodal AI) Workshop.`,
